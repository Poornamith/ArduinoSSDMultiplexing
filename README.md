# Seven Segment Display (SSD) Multiplexing Arduino project (Arduino UNO)

Arduino projects including:
  1. SSD Multiplexing - display a two digit number on two Seven Segment Displays
  2. SSD Countdown - count upto 99 from 0 using multiplexing

Proteus project files include:
  Project board for Arduino UNO.
  (please note that multiplexing will not work properly in the simulation as 20ms is a bit hard goal to achieve depending 
    on your display sync ratio. So use a delay more than 50ms instead of 10ms for simulation purposes only. )
